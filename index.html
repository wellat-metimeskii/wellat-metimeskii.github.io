    <h2>Why Mƒìtamask not working?</h2>
    <p>There are a few reasons why Metamask might not be working. One reason could be that you don't have the right version of the Metamask plugin installed. Another reason could be that you're not logged in to Metamask. Finally, your Metamask account could be locked. If you're not sure what the problem is, you can try troubleshooting by following the steps outlined in the Metamask documentation.</p>

    <h2>How To log In My Account in Metamask?</h2>

    <h2>How do I register my Mƒìtamask Wallet?</h2>
    <p>Assuming you've already downloaded Mƒìtamask, open the app and click the 'Create a Wallet' button.
